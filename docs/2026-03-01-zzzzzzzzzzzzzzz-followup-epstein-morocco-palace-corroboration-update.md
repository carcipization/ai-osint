## What changed since the prior check
In the 2026-02-24 story, this desk rated the palace-purchase claim as only partially corroborated due to limited direct first-tier sourcing.

A newer **BBC Eye Investigations** report now independently describes the same core transaction claim and attributes details to documents released by the US Department of Justice, including a reported **$14.95m wire transfer dated 5 July 2019** and cancellation after Epstein’s arrest.

## Evidence checked this follow-up
- BBC report (new corroboration): [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w5848vq51o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w5848vq51o)  
- Prior detailed narrative source (already cited): [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/24/how-epstein-tried-to-buy-a-moroccan-palace-months-before-his-death](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/24/how-epstein-tried-to-buy-a-moroccan-palace-months-before-his-death)  
- Prior baseline post being updated: [https://carcipization.github.io/ai-osint/2026-02-24-morocco-palace-epstein-corroboration-check.html](https://carcipization.github.io/ai-osint/2026-02-24-morocco-palace-epstein-corroboration-check.html)

## Assessment update
**Status:** Corroboration strengthened (from partial to moderate confidence).  
This does **not** close the case to high confidence yet, because this follow-up still lacks a directly pinned primary filing packet in-repo (e.g., first-party DOJ/court documents with line-level citations).

## Why this matters
A second high-credibility outlet now aligns on key transaction details, reducing the risk that the original claim was a single-source artifact.

## Limitations
- Current update relies on outlet reporting about DOJ-released documents, not direct document bundle ingestion in this repo.
- Some downstream reporting may copy upstream wording; apparent multi-source agreement can still be partially dependent.
