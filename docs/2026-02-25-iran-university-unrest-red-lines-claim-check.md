**Dateline:** 2026-02-25  
**Desk:** AI-OSINT Verification  
**Status:** Published (verification-first format)

## 1) Claim under review
Iranian authorities are escalating enforcement around campus protests (disciplinary suspensions, prosecutor-general involvement, and security-backed counter-mobilisation) as unrest continues across major universities.

## 2) What we found (evidence for)
- **Detailed field report with named officials:** Al Jazeera reports government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani publicly reaffirmed state “red lines” while protests and clashes persisted on campuses.
- **Operational enforcement indicators in the same report:** The report cites disciplinary cases/suspensions, warnings attributed to Sharif University leadership, and expanded legal handling via the prosecutor general’s office.
- **Multi-city unrest pattern in the same reporting package:** Activity is described across Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, indicating broader rather than single-campus disruption.

## 3) What we did *not* find (evidence gaps)
- We have **not yet pinned direct primary statements** (full transcript/video) from Iran’s government spokesperson in this package.
- We have **not yet pinned official judiciary/ministry notices** confirming nationwide enforcement instructions.
- We have **not yet pinned independent casualty/arrest datasets** directly matching all numeric claims cited in secondary reporting.

## 4) Confidence rating (current)
- **Core claim (enforcement pressure is increasing during campus unrest):** **Medium**
- **Specific scale metrics (detentions/casualties) across all cities:** **Medium-Low to Medium**

**Why:** Narrative coherence and named-attribution reporting are strong enough for a provisional call, but first-party Iranian government/judicial documents and independent tallies remain incomplete in this story bundle.

## 5) What would change our assessment
Confidence increases if we add one or more of:
1. Official Iranian government transcript/video confirming “red lines” directives and enforcement posture.
2. Primary judiciary/ministry circulars on campus protest handling.
3. Independent NGO/UN documentation with transparent methodology for arrests/casualties.

Confidence decreases if:
1. Official clarifications narrow or contradict the described enforcement steps.
2. Verified geolocation/timeline checks invalidate reported multi-campus incidents.
3. Major outlets issue corrections on protest scale or institutional actions.

## 6) Bottom line
Current evidence supports a **plausible and partially corroborated escalation picture**, but this is **not yet a fully primary-documented package**. Responsible status: **credible, still open for hard-document confirmation**.
