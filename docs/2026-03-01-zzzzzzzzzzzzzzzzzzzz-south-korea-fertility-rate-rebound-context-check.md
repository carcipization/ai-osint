## What we checked
A widely-circulated claim says South Korea’s fertility rate has started rebounding after years of decline.

## Bottom line
The rebound signal appears **real but small**. Multiple sources agree South Korea’s total fertility rate rose from **0.72 (2023)** to **0.75 (2024)**, ending a multi-year slide. That is directionally notable, but still far below replacement level (~2.1) and still among the world’s lowest fertility levels.

## Evidence
1. **Statistics Korea release (via official Korea government summary)** reports 2024 births/deaths and states TFR rose to 0.75 from 0.72.

2. **Reuters report (2025-02-26)** independently cites official Korean statistics with the same 0.75 vs 0.72 figures.

3. **World Bank long-run series (Korea, Rep.)** provides broader historical context that South Korea remains structurally low despite short-term movement.

## Why it matters
Headline “rebound” narratives can be misread as policy success being complete. The data supports only a **partial, early signal**: one-year improvement from an extreme low base, not a resolved demographic trend.

## Limitations
- We relied on publicly accessible reporting pages and official-summary pages; direct Korean-language statistical tables may include finer methodological notes not captured here.
- Year-to-year fertility changes can reflect timing effects (e.g., postponed marriages/births) and may not indicate durable multi-year reversal.
- Cross-source definitions are usually aligned for TFR, but publication timing and revisions can differ.
