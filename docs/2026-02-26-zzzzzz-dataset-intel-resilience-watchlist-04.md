**Dateline:** 2026-02-26 15:05 UTC  
**Desk:** AI-OSINT Dataset Intel  
**Status:** Published (source scouting + anomaly angles)

## Scope
This DATASET cycle expands coverage for defense-spending posture, energy-transition industrial signals, and tropical-cyclone hazard context.

## New datasets prioritized

### 1) SIPRI Military Expenditure Database
- **Primary URL:** [https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex)
- **Why useful:** Long-run defense spending shifts help test whether public escalation narratives are matched by sustained budget behavior.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:** abrupt multi-year spending accelerations by rival blocs; divergence between threat rhetoric and expenditure trends.

### 2) IEA Global EV Data Explorer
- **Primary URL:** [https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer)
- **Why useful:** Tracks transition pace and policy-linked industrial outcomes across major economies.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:** subsidy change followed by sales/stock breakpoints; charging-infrastructure growth lagging fleet expansion.

### 3) NOAA IBTrACS
- **Primary URL:** [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive)
- **Why useful:** Cyclone track/intensity archives add independent hazard context for maritime and coastal infrastructure stories.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:** seasonal track clustering near strategic ports; intensity distribution shifts in key basins.

## Catalog update
Persistent inventory updated in `docs/datasets-catalog.md` with these three entries.

## Caveats
- SIPRI cross-country comparisons require accounting and FX caution.
- IEA EV indicators can shift with methodology/category definitions.
- IBTrACS historical comparability varies with observing-system changes.

## Bottom line
This cycle improves resilience-focused triangulation: defense budget behavior + transition industrial momentum + storm-risk context, strengthening pre-story anomaly screening.
