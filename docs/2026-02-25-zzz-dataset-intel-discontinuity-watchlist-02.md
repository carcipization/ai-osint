**Dateline:** 2026-02-25  
**Desk:** AI-OSINT Dataset Intel  
**Status:** Published (source scouting + anomaly angles)

## Cycle objective
In this DATASET-mode cycle, we expanded the persistent watchlist with open/public sources that can reveal abrupt shifts across:
- Geopolitics and sanctions pressure
- International trade and maritime chokepoints
- US/Canada city-level crime dynamics
- AI governance / safety disclosure patterns

We prioritized sources with clear provenance and machine-readable access paths.

## Newly prioritized sources

### 1) OpenSanctions (aggregated sanctions/watchlists)
- **Primary URL:** [[[[[[[[https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/)
- **Why it matters:** Consolidates many official sanctions/watchlist sources into queryable datasets for cross-jurisdiction timeline monitoring.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:**
  - Sudden acceleration in listings tied to one country/sector over a short window
  - Cross-regime lag (EU/US/UK) between designation waves for same entity networks

### 2) UN Comtrade (monthly and annual trade flows)
- **Primary URL:** [[[[[[[[https://comtrade.un.org/](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)](https://comtrade.un.org/)
- **API/labs surface:** [[[[[[[[https://comtrade.un.org/labs/](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)](https://comtrade.un.org/labs/)
- **Why it matters:** Official bilateral commodity trade data supports embargo-evasion and rerouting hypotheses.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:**
  - Sharp rerouting in dual-use HS chapters through intermediary hubs
  - Mirror-stat discrepancy (exporter vs importer) widening after sanctions events

### 3) Global Fishing Watch (apparent fishing effort / vessel activity)
- **Primary URL:** [[[[[[[[https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/)
- **Why it matters:** Satellite/AIS-derived vessel activity can flag maritime behavior changes near contested zones.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:**
  - Sudden activity drop in disputed EEZs coincident with coercive incidents
  - Night-time effort displacement suggestive of enforcement pressure or spoofing risk

### 4) Edmonton EPS neighbourhood criminal occurrences (monthly)
- **Primary URL:** [[[[[[[[https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)](https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/dataset/EPS-Neighbourhood-Criminal-Occurrences/xthe-mnvi/data)
- **Why it matters:** Sub-city monthly panel for Canadian domestic-crime discontinuity checks beyond national aggregates.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:**
  - Neighbourhood-level category spikes diverging from citywide baseline
  - Structural break after local policy or deployment changes

### 5) AI Incident Database (AIAAIC)
- **Primary URL:** [[[[[[[[https://incidentdatabase.ai/](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)](https://incidentdatabase.ai/)
- **Why it matters:** Public incident records provide an external signal for model/system risk events over time.
- **Candidate anomaly angles:**
  - Incident frequency uptick in one capability domain (e.g., synthetic media fraud)
  - Growing lag between incident occurrence and public disclosure

## Practical fusion designs for next cycles
1. **Sanctions pressure stack:** OpenSanctions + official regime notices + trade reroute checks (Comtrade)
2. **Maritime coercion stack:** GFW vessel activity + AIS caveat checks + conflict-event datasets (ACLED/UCDP)
3. **Urban crime stack (Canada):** Toronto MCI + Edmonton EPS monthly panel + StatsCan tables
4. **AI risk/governance stack:** HELM/OECD.AI + AI Incident Database for capability-risk divergence tracking

## Caveats
- Aggregators (e.g., OpenSanctions) are powerful but should still be cross-checked against originating authority pages before high-stakes claims.
- UN Comtrade publication lag and revisions can blur very short-window inference.
- AIS-based systems can be affected by transponder behavior, coverage gaps, and spoofing.
- Incident databases may be media-reporting dependent and not exhaustive.

## Bottom line
This cycle adds high-utility sources for detecting discontinuities in sanctions dynamics, trade rerouting, maritime behavior, Canadian city crime, and AI incident reporting. The watchlist is now better structured for cross-source corroboration instead of single-feed narratives.
