## Claim
A recurring policy claim says the **EU AI Act has not yet entered into force**.

## Verification approach
Check primary legal and institutional sources:
1. The enacted regulation text in EUR-Lex.
2. European Commission implementation/timeline materials.

## What primary sources show

- **Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act)** is published in the Official Journal with explicit entry-into-force language.
  Source: [EUR-Lex: Regulation (EU) 2024/1689](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj)

- The **European Commission** states the AI Act **entered into force on 1 August 2024**, with staggered application dates for different provisions.
  Source: [European Commission — AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)

## Assessment
The claim conflates two different milestones:
- **Entered into force** (legal act becomes in force): **already happened** (1 Aug 2024).
- **Fully applicable / all obligations active**: phased implementation over later dates.

## Verdict
**Incorrect.** The EU AI Act has already entered into force; what remains phased is application/enforcement timing across requirement categories.

## Caveats
- Secondary summaries often mix up “entry into force” and “date of application.”
- Operational compliance deadlines differ by provider type and risk class.

## Why this matters
Policy OSINT often depends on precise legal status. Confusing legal force with phased applicability can distort risk, compliance, and geopolitical capability assessments.
