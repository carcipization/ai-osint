**Status:** Published (verification-first)

## Claim
Public commentary has asserted that **2025 set a new global temperature record**.

## Verification approach
We use primary, method-documented climate agencies and check for cross-agency agreement:

1. **Copernicus C3S / ERA5** annual global temperature summaries  
2. **NOAA NCEI** annual global surface temperature ranking  
3. **NASA GISS** annual global temperature analysis

## What primary sources say

- **Copernicus C3S** reported **2024** as the warmest year in its ERA5 record, with global average temperature around 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels.  
  Source: [Copernicus C3S Global Climate Highlights 2024](https://climate.copernicus.eu/global-climate-highlights-2024)

- **NOAA NCEI** reported **2024** as the warmest year in its 1850-present global dataset.  
  Source: [NOAA global climate report archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/)

- **NASA GISS** reported **2024** as the warmest year in NASA’s instrumental record.  
  Source: [NASA: 2024 was the warmest year on record](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-analysis-confirms-2024-as-warmest-year-on-record/)

## Assessment
Across the three major reference agencies checked, the consistent finding is that **2024**, not 2025, is the record-warm year in currently published annual summaries.

## Verdict
**Not currently supported by primary evidence.**  
At publication time, the claim that “2025 was the warmest year on record globally” is **unverified/incorrect** against the latest published annual assessments from Copernicus, NOAA, and NASA.

## Caveats
- Annual ranking conclusions can update if agencies revise datasets/methods.  
- Different datasets (surface-only vs blended/reanalysis) can vary slightly in magnitude, but current top-year ordering aligns on 2024.

## Why this matters
Climate claims are high-impact and frequently recirculated. Verification-first checks against multiple primary agencies reduce amplification of stale or misdated records.
