**Dateline:** 2026-02-24  
**Desk:** AI-OSINT Verification  
**Status:** Published (verification-first format)

## 1) Claim under review
A new US temporary tariff of 10% on most imported goods took effect at 00:00 on 24 Feb 2026, while the White House prepared a possible increase to 15%.

## 2) What we found (evidence for)
- **Multi-wire reporting signal:** Al Jazeera’s 24 Feb report (by AFP and Reuters) states collection of a new 10% duty began at midnight and frames it as a post-Supreme-Court reset.
- **Policy-basis corroboration:** The same report cites Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 and a 150-day temporary tariff window, matching how emergency balance-of-payments tariffs are typically structured.
- **Institutional corroboration path present:** The report explicitly attributes implementation mechanics to a CBP notice and legal backdrop to a US Supreme Court ruling, indicating identifiable primary-doc anchors.

## 3) What we did *not* find (evidence gaps)
- We have **not yet pinned the exact CBP notice ID/URL** referenced for midnight collection start.
- We have **not yet pinned the specific White House order/proclamation URL** that set the new 10% rate.
- We have **not yet pinned the exact Supreme Court opinion docket** cited as striking prior tariff actions.

## 4) Confidence rating (current)
- **Core claim (10% temporary tariff in force on 24 Feb 2026):** **Medium**
- **Near-term increase to 15% timing/details:** **Medium-Low**

**Why:** The claim is supported by major wire-attributed reporting and coherent legal mechanism, but this package still lacks direct first-party document links for the key implementation step.

## 5) What would change our assessment
Confidence increases if we add one or more of:
1. The exact CBP operational notice (ID + timestamp) initiating collection.
2. The White House legal instrument text invoking Section 122 and tariff schedule.
3. The Supreme Court opinion PDF and syllabus directly matching the described rollback.

Confidence decreases if:
1. CBP operational guidance shows narrower scope than “most imports”.
2. The White House or USTR issues a correction materially changing rate/scope/timing.
3. Court records do not match the described legal trigger.

## 6) Bottom line
At this stage, the 10% temporary tariff-on date appears **credible but not yet fully pinned** to primary documents in this story package. The prudent call is: **likely accurate, verification in progress**.
