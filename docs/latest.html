<strong>Status:</strong> Published (verification-first format)</p>
<h2 id="1-claim-under-review">1) Claim under review</h2>
<p>Iranian authorities are escalating enforcement around campus protests (disciplinary suspensions, prosecutor-general involvement, and security-backed counter-mobilisation) as unrest continues across major universities.</p>
<h2 id="2-what-we-found-evidence-for">2) What we found (evidence for)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed field report with named officials:</strong> Al Jazeera reports government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani publicly reaffirmed state “red lines” while protests and clashes persisted on campuses.</li>
<li><strong>Operational enforcement indicators in the same report:</strong> The report cites disciplinary cases/suspensions, warnings attributed to Sharif University leadership, and expanded legal handling via the prosecutor general’s office.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-city unrest pattern in the same reporting package:</strong> Activity is described across Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, indicating broader rather than single-campus disruption.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-what-we-did-not-find-evidence-gaps">3) What we did <em>not</em> find (evidence gaps)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have <strong>not yet pinned direct primary statements</strong> (full transcript/video) from Iran’s government spokesperson in this package.</li>
<li>We have <strong>not yet pinned official judiciary/ministry notices</strong> confirming nationwide enforcement instructions.</li>
<li>We have <strong>not yet pinned independent casualty/arrest datasets</strong> directly matching all numeric claims cited in secondary reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-confidence-rating-current">4) Confidence rating (current)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core claim (enforcement pressure is increasing during campus unrest):</strong> <strong>Medium</strong></li>
<li><strong>Specific scale metrics (detentions/casualties) across all cities:</strong> <strong>Medium-Low to Medium</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Narrative coherence and named-attribution reporting are strong enough for a provisional call, but first-party Iranian government/judicial documents and independent tallies remain incomplete in this story bundle.</p>
<h2 id="5-what-would-change-our-assessment">5) What would change our assessment</h2>
<p>Confidence increases if we add one or more of:
1. Official Iranian government transcript/video confirming “red lines” directives and enforcement posture.
2. Primary judiciary/ministry circulars on campus protest handling.
3. Independent NGO/UN documentation with transparent methodology for arrests/casualties.</p>
<p>Confidence decreases if:
1. Official clarifications narrow or contradict the described enforcement steps.
2. Verified geolocation/timeline checks invalidate reported multi-campus incidents.
3. Major outlets issue corrections on protest scale or institutional actions.</p>
<h2 id="6-bottom-line">6) Bottom line</h2>
<p>Current evidence supports a <strong>plausible and partially corroborated escalation picture</strong>, but this is <strong>not yet a fully primary-documented package</strong>. Responsible status: <strong>credible, still open for hard-document confirmation</strong>.</p>
